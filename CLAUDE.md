# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

A PowerShell-based infrastructure toolkit that creates an isolated Hyper-V sandbox VM on Windows, purpose-built for running Claude Code with a native MSVC toolchain. Claude Code runs inside the VM, builds real Windows binaries (C++, Rust), and artifacts are extracted back to the host via PowerShell Direct (VMBus — no network required).

**Requirements to use this project:** Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise with Hyper-V, a Windows 11 ISO, and a Claude Pro subscription. All scripts must be run as Administrator.

## Key Commands

### First-Time Setup

```powershell
# Step 1: Create VM, partition VHDX, apply Windows via DISM (prompts for ISO path)
.\Bootstrap.ps1

# Step 2: Provision toolchain (run on host — switches network, copies files into VM)
.\scripts\Start-Provision.ps1
# Then inside the VM:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Invoke-Provision.ps1

# Step 3: Save the clean snapshot (shut down VM first)
.\scripts\Save-BaseSnapshot.ps1
```

### Daily Development

```powershell
# Basic session (VM fully isolated, no internet)
.\Start-Session.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\Projects\myapp

# With internet (needed for cargo fetch, npm install, etc.)
.\Start-Session.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\Projects\myapp -Internet

# Restore to clean snapshot before starting (reproducible build)
.\Start-Session.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\Projects\myapp -Restore -Internet

# Auto-extract artifacts when VM shuts down
.\Start-Session.ps1 -ProjectPath C:\Projects\myapp -Internet -ExtractOnExit
```

Inside the VM after session starts:
```powershell
cd C:\workspace
claude
```

### Artifact Extraction

```powershell
# Extract .exe/.dll/.pdb from C:\workspace\target\release
.\scripts\Copy-Artifacts.ps1 -DestPath C:\Projects\myapp\artifacts

# Wait for VM shutdown then extract
.\scripts\Copy-Artifacts.ps1 -WaitForShutdown

# Include additional file types
.\scripts\Copy-Artifacts.ps1 -ExtraPatterns "*.json","*.toml"
```

### VM Management

```powershell
# Manually restore to clean snapshot
Stop-VM -Name ClaudeDevSandbox -Force
Restore-VMCheckpoint -VMName ClaudeDevSandbox -Name CleanProvisionedBase -Confirm:$false

# Re-authenticate when OAuth expires (run inside VM with internet)
claude login
# Then shut down and re-snapshot
```

## Architecture

### Script Roles

| Script | Where It Runs | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `Bootstrap.ps1` | Host | One-time setup orchestrator |
| `scripts/New-ClaudeVM.ps1` | Host | Creates Gen 2 VM (TPM, Secure Boot, SCSI layout) |
| `scripts/Install-Windows.ps1` | Host | Applies Windows to VHDX via DISM (bypasses DVD boot) |
| `scripts/Start-Provision.ps1` | Host | Switches to Default Switch, copies VS layout + provisioner into VM |
| `scripts/Invoke-Provision.ps1` | **VM** | Installs VS Build Tools, Rust (MSVC), Node.js, Claude Code, enables PSRemoting |
| `scripts/Save-BaseSnapshot.ps1` | Host | Captures `CleanProvisionedBase` checkpoint |
| `scripts/Save-VMCredentials.ps1` | Host | Encrypts VM creds to `~/.claude-sandbox/vm-cred.xml` |
| `Start-Session.ps1` | Host | Daily driver: restore/switch network/sync project/open console |
| `scripts/Copy-Artifacts.ps1` | Host | Pulls build outputs from VM via PowerShell Direct |
| `vm/Start-ClaudeCode.ps1` | VM | Optional VM startup script |

### File Transfer Strategy

All host↔VM file transfer uses **PowerShell Direct** (VMBus), which works without any network configuration:
- Project sync into VM: `Copy-Item -ToSession` (excludes `artifacts/`, `.git/`, `target/`)
- Artifact extraction: `Copy-Item -FromSession`
- Pre-boot fallback: robocopy to SMB share at `\\localhost\ClaudeSandboxShare`

### Networking

Two modes, switched via `Connect-VMNetworkAdapter`:
- **`Claude-Internal`** (default): internal switch, VM can reach host but not internet
- **`Default Switch`**: NAT switch, gives VM internet access for package fetches

### Configuration

All scripts read `~/.claude-sandbox/config.json` (written by Bootstrap.ps1):
```json
{
  "VMName": "ClaudeDevSandbox",
  "VMPath": "D:\\Hyper-V\\ClaudeDevSandbox",
  "SharedDrive": "D:\\Hyper-V\\Shared",
  "CacheRoot": "D:\\ClaudeSandboxCache",
  "CredPath": "%USERPROFILE%\\.claude-sandbox",
  "ProjectsRoot": "D:\\workspace"
}
```
Credentials are stored as an encrypted `vm-cred.xml` (only readable by the host Windows user who created it).

### VM Spec (set in `New-ClaudeVM.ps1`)

- Gen 2, 80 GB dynamic VHDX, 4 vCPU, 4 GB RAM (dynamic 2–4 GB)
- Secure Boot + TPM 2.0 (required for Windows 11)
- HDD on SCSI controller 0, DVD on SCSI controller 1 — separated to avoid Gen 2 boot ordering issues
- Automatic checkpoints disabled; checkpoint type set to Production

### Toolchain Inside VM (installed by `Invoke-Provision.ps1`)

- VS Build Tools 2026 with `VCTools` workload + Windows 11 SDK 26100 + CMake
- Rust stable (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) with clippy and rustfmt
- Node.js (latest via winget)
- Claude Code (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) authenticated via OAuth

## Conventions

- All scripts use `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` — any uncaught error aborts execution.
- Scripts that create directories use `New-Item -Force` to be idempotent.
- `robocopy` exit codes 0–7 are success; the scripts treat non-zero robocopy exit as non-fatal (pipe to `Out-Null`).
- The VS Build Tools offline layout (`D:\ClaudeSandboxCache\vs-layout\`) is downloaded once during Bootstrap and reused on every provision — avoid deleting it.
- `Copy-Artifacts.ps1` defaults to extracting `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.pdb` from `C:\workspace\target\release`; pass `-ExtraPatterns` for additional types.
